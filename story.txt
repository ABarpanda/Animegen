A long, long time ago, there lived a hare in the forest who always boasted of his running speed. He would often tease the tortoise for being the slowest animal around. One fine day, he dared the tortoise to a race in order to exhibit his skills in front of other animals in the forest. Fed up with the hare’s bragging, the tortoise finally accepted the challenge and decided to compete him in a race.On the day of the race, all the animals of the forest gathered to watch the competition between the hare and the tortoise. Just as they were about to begin the race, the hare mocked the tortoise for accepting the challenge. Further, he also mentioned that soon after he wins the race, the tortoise would be ridiculed by other animals for accepting the dare. The tortoise kept silent and didn’t pay heed to the hare’s words. The race began at the count of one, two and three! The hare immediately started running and the tortoise started at its usual slow pace. Soon the hare reached a long way ahead almost a few yards from the finish line.
